<p>Guitar is a versatile musical instrument that can be easily carried to a performance. Unlike a piano, which I also have.</p>
<p>I took guitar lessons when I was an extremely awkward and geeky teenage boy. Guitar really preserved my sanity. 
  When I got in my forties, I discovered Mississippi John Hurt. My interest was re-kindled.</p>
